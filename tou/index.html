							<p><strong>1.7 Intended Use Of Product.</strong> The XKlaim Card is a virtual, single use prepaid card issued at the request of a an individual or merchant (the &quot;Purchaser&quot;) for use at a merchant that accepts credit cards. The XKlaim Card is issued at the request of the Purchaser to a designated recipient (&quot;Recipient(s)&quot;) for that Recipient's use in making a purchase at a specified merchant, therefore this card is considered &quot;closed loop&quot; and may only be used at the store specified and is therefore limited to a single purchase at the specified merchant. Additional Card features include: XKlaim Cards are purchased and redeemed using a consumer facing mobile phone app on the XKLAIM platform (the &quot;XKlaim App&quot; or &quot;App&quot;). The product is geared toward friends and family who wish to enable specific purchases by other family members and friends. For example, parents can use the XKlaim App (which is tied in to their credit card) to issue XKlaim Cards to their children for purchases of particular items at particular stores. XKlaim Card Purchasers are charged a one-time issuance fee of 5% at the time of each Card purchase (the &quot;Issuance Fee&quot;), subject to applicable state law, which fee is charged to their credit card. (State of use is identified using geo-location and zip code information, all applicable state laws govern fees and usage of the card issued through XKlaim Inc and will override information in this agreement. This includes, but is not limited to the rules for fees in the states of Colorado, Hawaii, Maine, Michigan, New Mexico, Vermont, and Louisiana. User will receive a notification at the time of purchase of any such conflict and what the adjusted fee is for the state where the transaction takes place). No service, dormancy, inactivity or redemption fees are associated with the XKlaim Cards. When purchasing an XKlaim Card, each Purchaser is asked to set a usage time frame during which the Card is expected be used (e.g., the next 24 hours; through the end of this week; etc.). If the funds loaded to the XKlaim Card are not used by the Recipient within this usage time frame, the funds are refunded to the Purchaser automatically, and a fee of 5% of the face value of the XKlaim Card is deducted from the Card value prior to returning the value of the XKlaim Card to the Purchaser (the &quot;Return of Funds Fee&quot;), subject to applicable state law (user will receive a notification of fee amount at time of charge and any conflict will be determined by user's location and applicable state law will prevail in the determining of fees or if such fee is allowed by the state where the transaction takes place). In addition, so long as the Card has not been used, Purchaser may also request that the XKlaim Card be cancelled, prior to the end of the usage time frame. In such instance, the Return of Funds Fee in the amount of 5% of the face value of the XKlaim Card is deducted from the Card value prior to returning the value of the XKlaim Card to the Purchaser. When the Purchaser makes such a cancellation request, funds are returned to the Purchaser in less than 24 hours following the Purchaser's request to cancel an XKlaim Card. The maximum value of an XKlaim Card is currently set at $400. A limit on the number of Cards a Purchaser can request each day will also be set. If one Purchaser requests more than the maximum number of Cards, then the Purchaser's account is flagged for review and potentially blocked. No Purchaser will be allowed to purchase more than $2,000 in Cards per day. A Purchaser's ability to purchase a Card is also blocked on the fourth request for the same dollar amount in one day (since it would be rare for that many single item store purchases to equal the same amount). A Recipient may only use a Card a single time, so, for example, if only one of several items is purchased, the Card may not be used later for a separate purchase.In the background, the XKlaim App uses geo-location data from the Recipient's mobile phone to identify his or her current location and limit the visibility of the virtual Card on their mobile phone to the specific merchant location approved by Purchaser. If Recipient tries to use the Card at a location other than the location approved by the Purchaser, and the geo-locator is able to discern this, the transaction will be declined and the Card will be cancelled. However, if the Recipient attempts to use the Card at a store near the requested store, the geo-location data may not be specific enough for the (s)XKLAIM platform to identify the new store. In this case, the Recipient's attempt to use the Card in the other store may be successful. If a Recipient is successful in using a Card in a store other than the requested store, the XKlaim Card platform will notify XKLAIM, who will in turn notify the Purchaser and the Recipient, that Recipient is attempting to use, or has succeeded in using, the Card for a purchase in a store other than the one originally requested. This is considered a breach of contract and the Recipient and possibly the Purchaser will not be allowed further use of the XKlaim App. Any use of a card approved for a requested store and presented for redemption in a non-requested store constitutes a violation of these terms and conditions. Any such uses will be in breach of contract, and XKLAIM has reasonable measures in place to identify violations and enforce its restrictions.</p>

							<p>The product is also geared towards Brands and Merchants who want to give shoppers and offer that is only redeemable at their store. The xKlaim card used in this way has all the same controls and advantages described above.</p>

							<p>Burlingame, California 94010</p>

							<p>or fax to: (866) 344-3927 Attn: DMCA Complaints</p>

							<p>NOTHING IN THIS SECTION 10. IS INTENDED TO EXPAND OR SUPPLEMENT THE LEGAL RIGHTS, PROCEDURES AND REMEDIES AUTHORIZED AND GRANTED UNDER DMCA AND WE DO NOT REPRESENT ANY RELATED UNDERTAKING BY XKLAIM NOT OTHERWISE EXPRESSLY REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW.</p>

							<p><strong>11. TERMINATION.</strong> XKlaim may, in its sole and absolute discretion, at any time and for any or no reason, suspend or terminate this License and the rights afforded to You hereunder with or without prior notice. Furthermore, if We determine in Our sole discretion that You have violated or failed to comply with any terms and conditions of this License, then this License and any rights afforded to You hereunder shall terminate automatically, without any notice or other action by XKlaim. Upon the termination of this License, You shall cease all use of the Services and uninstall the Mobile Application from Your Mobile Device. XKlaim reserves the right to terminate or disable all or any portion of the Mobile Application via update of the Mobile Application.</p>

							<p><strong>12. CLAIMS AND DISPUTES.</strong></p>

							<p><strong>12.1</strong> Legal Disputes. You and XKlaim agree that any claim or dispute at law or equity that has arisen or may arise between us will be resolved in accordance with the provisions set forth in this Claims and Disputes Section. Please read this Section carefully.  It affects your rights and will have a substantial impact on how claims you and we have against each other are resolved.</p>

							<p><strong>12.2</strong> Applicable Law. You agree that the laws of the State of California, without regard to principles of conflict of laws, will govern this User Agreement and any claim or dispute that has arisen or may arise between you and XKlaim, except as otherwise stated in this User Agreement.</p>

							<p><strong>12.3</strong> Agreement to Arbitrate. We both each agree that any and all disputes or claims that have arisen or may arise between us shall be resolved exclusively through final and binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that you may assert claims in small claims court, if your claims qualify.  The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Agreement to Arbitrate.</p>

							<p><strong>12.4</strong> Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief. YOU AND XKLAIM AGREE THAT EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS PART OF ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING. UNLESS WE AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN MORE THAN ONE PERSON'S OR PARTY'S CLAIMS, AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE, OR CLASS PROCEEDING.  ALSO, THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF (INCLUDING MONETARY, INJUNCTIVE, AND DECLARATORY RELIEF) ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF NECESSITATED BY THAT PARTY'S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S).  ANY RELIEF AWARDED CANNOT AFFECT OTHER XKLAIM USERS.</p>

							<p><strong>12.5</strong> Arbitration Procedures. The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") under its rules and procedures, including the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes (as applicable), as modified by this Agreement to Arbitrate.  The AAA's rules are available at www.adr.org.  A form for initiating arbitration proceedings is available on the AAA's website at <a href="http://www.adr.org/">www.adr.org</a>. The arbitration shall be held in the county in which you reside or at another mutually agreed location.  If the value of the relief sought is $10,000 or less, you or XKlaim may elect to have the arbitration conducted by telephone or based solely on written submissions, which election shall be binding on you and XKlaim subject to the arbitrator's discretion to require an in-person hearing, if the circumstances warrant.  Attendance at an in-person hearing may be made by telephone by you and/or XKlaim, unless the arbitrator requires otherwise.  ?The arbitrator will decide the substance of all claims in accordance with the laws of the State of Utah, including recognized principles of equity, and will honor all claims of privilege recognized by law.  The arbitrator shall not be bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving different XKlaim users, but is bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving the same XKlaim user to the extent required by applicable law.  The arbitrator's award shall be final and binding and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.</p>

							<p><strong>12.6</strong> Costs of Arbitration. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's rules, unless otherwise stated in this Agreement to Arbitrate.  If the value of the relief sought is $10,000 or less, at your request, XKlaim will pay all filling, administration, and arbitrator fees associated with the arbitration.  Any request for payment of fees by XKlaim should be submitted by mail to the AAA along with your Demand for Arbitration and XKlaim will make arrangements to pay all necessary fees directly to the AAA.  If the value of the relief sought is more than $10,000 and you are able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, XKlaim will pay as much of the filing, administration, and arbitrator fees as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive.  In the event the arbitrator determines the claim(s) you assert in the arbitration to be frivolous, you agree to reimburse XKlaim for all fees associated with the arbitration paid by XKlaim on your behalf, which you otherwise would be obligated to pay under the AAA's rules.</p>

							<p><strong>12.7</strong> Opt-Out Procedure. You can choose to reject this Agreement to Arbitrate ("opt-out") by mailing us a written opt-out notice ("Opt-Out Notice").  You must mail the Opt-Out Notice to:</p>

							<p>XKlaim, Inc.</p>

							<p>1325 Howard Ave. Ste. 258</p>

You must sign the Opt-Out Notice for it to be effective. This procedure is the only way you can opt-out of the Agreement to Arbitrate. If you opt-out of the Agreement to Arbitrate, all other parts of the License will continue to apply to you. Opting out of this Agreement to Arbitrate has no effect on any previous, other, or future arbitration agreements that you may have with us.</p>

							<p><strong>12.8</strong> Judicial Forum for Legal Disputes. Unless we agree otherwise, in the event that the Agreement to Arbitrate above is found not to apply to You or to a particular claim or dispute, either as a result of your decision to opt-out of the Agreement to Arbitrate or a court order, You agree that any claim or dispute that has arisen or may arise between you and XKlaim must be resolved exclusively by a state or federal court located in San Francisco County, CA.  You and XKlaim agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within San Francisco County, CA for the purpose of litigating all such claims or disputes.</p>

							<p><strong>12.9</strong> Limited Time to Bring Claim. You acknowledge and agree that that it is the intent of both You and XKlaim to limit the period of time a claim may be filed, even if the period is shorter than that fixed by the statute of limitations. You therefore agree that any claim or dispute arising out of or related to the Services must be arbitrated (or if the Agreement to Arbitrate above is found not to apply to You or to a particular claim or dispute, that any cause of arising out of or related to the Services must be commence), within one (1) year after the claim or dispute first occurs (or cause of action accrues), otherwise such claim or dispute (or cause of action), is permanently barred. </p>

							<p><strong>13.6</strong> Any waiver of any provision of this License will be effective only if in writing and signed by You and XKlaim. Our failure to enforce Our rights and remedies available to Us with respect Your breach of this License shall not constitute a waiver of such breach nor of any prior, concurrent, or subsequent breach of the same or any other provision of this License. </p>

							<p><strong>13.7</strong> You may not assign this License or otherwise transfer Your obligations or interests under this License, in whole or in part; any attempt to do so shall be void.</p>

							<p><strong>13.8</strong> If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of this License to be invalid or unenforceable, that provision will be superseded by a valid, enforceable provision that most closely matches the intent of the original provision, and the remainder of the License will continue in effect and remain fully enforceable.</p>
